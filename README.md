# jekyll-dummy-content

Jekyll-dummy-content is for starting new jekyll themes with placeholder content. It contains a range of different content scenarios (long posts, short posts, long titles, short titles, etc) for testing layouts in realistic scenarios, and fringe scenarios.

There are no customizations to the jekyll theme itself, it's literally just the default `jekyll new` site with a bunch of dummy posts.

[Preview it here](http://joelglovier.com/jekyll-dummy-content/), or just fork and start building or testing your theme!

## Usage

**Option A** - Fork the project and modify the template files accordingly. Use the dummy posts to help you consider possible content scenarios, and design accordingly. When you are ready to ship your theme or project, simply delete the dummy posts.

**Option B** - [Download posts](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-dummy-content/tree/gh-pages/_posts) directly from the `_posts` folder into your existing Jekyll project to test content in the same way as Option A.
